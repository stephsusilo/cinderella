Help Cinderella get to the ball! Guide her down the stairs and help her run away from her three evil stepsisters in this Cinderella-themed chaser game! Don’t let the sisters get to Cinderella as her health (displayed on the progress bar) will decrease. Once her health reaches zero, the game ends. 

Game Features
- Player sprite: Cinderella’s movement is controlled by the cursor. 
- Enemy sprite: Three evil enemies are created at the start of play with locations and speeds set randomly.
- Scarecrow: Click anywhere on the canvas to set a glass slipper “scarecrow” to distract Cinderella’s evil step sisters. They will move towards the scarecrow for 5 seconds. During this time, no new scarecrows can be set.
- Health: The progress bar is set at 100 at the start of play and will decrease by 1 point each time Cinderella collides with the enemy.
- Music: Setting a scarecrow will trigger a twinkling sound and set off the background music of “Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo”.

Game Controls
- Control Cinderella’s movement by using the mouse to guide her
